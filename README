Puppet-Module for configuring Puppet itself, both the master and the clients
============================================================================

Use a seperate local module called "site-puppet", where you place your customized 
files, under:
 site-puppet/files/master/fileserver.conf
 site-puppet/files/master/puppet.conf

those files in this module are just examples.

Usage
-----
If you want to run the puppetmaster in a non-webrick based
mode, you can set $puppetmaster_mode either to:

* passenger, run puppetmaster as a passenger application
* cluster, run puppetmaster as a mongrel based cluster

In both cases you have to setup the appropriate frontends
(apache vhost configuration/nginx vhost configuration) on
your own.

in your site.pp, i.e. :

    $puppet_crontime = "0,12 * * * *"
    include puppet::cron
    
    $puppetmaster_mode = 'passenger'
    include puppet::puppetmaster
    
    $puppet_storeconfig_password="..."
    include puppet::puppetmaster::storeconfigs

...tbc...
